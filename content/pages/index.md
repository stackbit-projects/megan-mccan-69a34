      - title: Composite Bonding
        subtitle: Affordable teeth restoration
        content: >
          Composite bonding is the process of colour matching and restoring a
          tooth with composite ensuring a natural blend with the colour of your
          teeth. It can be carried out in a single session and is an affordable
          alternative to veneers. This is a discreet and minimally invasive
          method of repairing a damaged (cracked/chipped) or misshapen tooth.

          between appointments... IO used to fear the dentist and now I love it!

          Megan was so lovely with me. She explained every bit of the process
          and didn't make me feel embarrassed about the state of my teeth.
